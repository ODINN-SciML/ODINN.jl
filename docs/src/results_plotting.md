# Results and plotting

## Results

Every `Simulation` type has an associated `Results` object(s), one for each one of the glaciers in the simulation. This object, as its name indicates, stores all the results of the simulation, which can be used for data anlysis and plotting. These types are handled by `Sleipnir.jl`.

```@docs
Sleipnir.Results
Sleipnir.Results(glacier::G, ifm::IF) where {G <: AbstractGlacier, F <: AbstractFloat, IF <: AbstractModel, I <: Integer}
```

## Plots

One of the main things one can do with a `Results` object, is plotting them. The main function to do so is the following one:

```@docs
Sleipnir.plot_glacier
```

Another option is to generate a video of the evolution of the glacier's ice thickness during the simulation:

```@docs
Sleipnir.plot_glacier_vid
```
