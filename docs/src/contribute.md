# How to contribute

We welcome all types of contributions to the ODINN ecosystem! Most of the code, documentation, and features of ODINN are constantly under development, so your feedback can be very helpful! If you are interested in contributing, there are many ways in which you can help:

- **Report bugs in the code.** You can report problems with the code by opening issues under the [issues](https://github.com/ODINN-SciML/ODINN.jl/issues) tab in the ODINN repository. Please explain the problem you encounter and try to give a complete description of it so we can follow up on that.
- **Request new features and documentation.** If there is an important topic or example that you feel falls under the scope of this review and you would like us to include it, please request it! We are looking for new insights into what the community wants to learn.
- **Contribute to the source code.** We welcome pull requests (PRs) to any  of the libraries in the ODINN ecosystem. In order to contribute, please make a fork of the repository you would like to contribute to, and then submit a PR to the `dev` branch (`main` is only updated from time to time when enough meaningful commits are available to perform a new release). We will review your PR it and provide feedback. If you are looking for ideas of how to contribute with code, you can check the [opened issues](https://github.com/ODINN-SciML/ODINN.jl/issues) in our repositories.
